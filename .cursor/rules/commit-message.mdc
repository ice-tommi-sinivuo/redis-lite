# Commit Message Guidelines

## Commit Message Structure
- The title should summarize what the changes in the commit achieve (the intent)
- Include all relevant information about what has changed and why the change has been made
- Include the JIRA issue key as the last entry in the commit message
- Include the type of the change as a prefix for the commit message title inside square brackets. The allowed types are:
    - feat
    - fix
    - test
	- chore
	- docs
	- refactor
	- style
	- perf

## Example Format
