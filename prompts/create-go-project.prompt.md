Create a new Go project.

Please help me initialize a barebones Go project for that purpose inside the current folder (the current folder is the project folder, so please initialize it right here without an additional subfolder). make the application itself a simple "Hello world!" application, so that we can make sure that our environment works.

Ensure the project structure is clean and follows Go conventions.

If the project name is not provided, prompt the user for a project name.

Assume Go version 1.23
