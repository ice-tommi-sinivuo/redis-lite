Create Jira issues based on an implementation plan.
The implementation plan is provided in the file `docs/plan.md`.
Please follow the workflow below carefully to create the Jira issues successfully.

## Workflow

1. Read the implementation plan from `docs/plan.md`
2. Identify the key steps in the plan that can be translated into Jira issues
3. For each step, create a Jira issue with the following details:
   - **Summary**: A concise title for the issue
   - **Description**: A detailed description of the task, including the goal and deliverables
   - **Type**: Set the issue type to "Task"
4. Provide a summary of the Jira issues created to the human developer.

DO NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE THAN CREATING THE JIRA ISSUES! E.g. do not implement any code or initialize anything.
