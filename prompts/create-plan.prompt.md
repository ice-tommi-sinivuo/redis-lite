Create an implementation plan for a project.

Please ask for project description and requirements if not provided.

Please make a high level plan for in which order the various parts of the project is best to be implemented, so that we can get a good foundation to work on. Provide the plan as a series of implementation steps, each of them having a small and clear goal. We want have something working end-to-end as soon as possible, so please split the work in narrow complete vertical slices.

Take the following steps while working out the plan:

1. Familiarize yourself with the project domain and requirements.
2. Research what needs to be implemented in order to support the required use cases.
3. Plan a simple architecture for the program that is easy to extend. Don't over-engineer it.
4. Make a plan by planning narrow vertical slices from the work that needs to be done to implement the project's features and arhitecture.
5. Validate the plan by double checking it
6. Output the plan as a series of small steps that each contain a vertical slice to implement, each step building on each other.

Output the plan in markdown format into the file `docs/plan.md` in the project repository.

DO NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE THAN CREATING THE PLAN! E.g. do not implement any code or initialize anything.
