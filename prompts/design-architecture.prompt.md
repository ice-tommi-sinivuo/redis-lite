Design the architecture of a project based on an implementation plan.

The implemenation plan is provided in the file `docs/plan.md`.

Please follow the workflow below carefully to design the architecture successfully.

If you draw diagrams or charts, please use the mermaid chart format for visually appealing diagrams.

## Workflow

1. Read the implementation plan from `docs/plan.md`
2. Understand the technical requirements and constraints of the project
3. Identify the key components and their interactions based on the plan
4. Design a simple architecture that is easy to extend and maintain
5. Validate the architecture by double checking it against the implementation plan
6. Document the architecture in `docs/architecture.md`

DO NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE THAN DESIGNING THE ARCHITECTURE IN THE `docs/architecture.md` FILE! E.g. do not implement any code or initialize anything.
